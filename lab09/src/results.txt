MyhashMap is a bit slower than Java's built-in HashMap,
which may cause by using linked-list for the buckets while java's built-in HashMap had transits to using red-black trees for buckets.

When we don't care about the order of entries, HashMap has a better average time complexity.
Especially useful for tasks like counting, caching, or scenarios where insertion, deletions and lookups are random.
